Final Project Report _ Trend Analysis of GDP Growth by Continent and per Capita

This project uses different sources from the web to gather information and data about countries' annual GDP. We were looking to identify the general trends and patterns of GDP growth by continents from which we were able to conclude that there is a increasing pattern over time. We dived deeper into the problem to identify whether the pattern we found had any associations with the top ranked countries by their GDP per capita value. Interestingly, we objserved an unexpected outcome, because the continent which had the most noticeable growth had no close relationship with the top-ranked GDP per capita countries.
